# 🤖 Personal Content Engine

**Complete automation system for generating viral TikTok content from winning products**

The Personal Content Engine is a foolproof system that scrapes FastMoss and KoloData to identify trending products, analyzes their viral potential, generates compelling scripts using AI, and creates professional avatar videos automatically.

## 🚀 **Why This Approach is Foolproof**

- **No API Dependencies**: Uses web scraping instead of unreliable APIs
- **Works Immediately**: No approvals or partnerships needed
- **Complete Control**: Access any data visible in dashboards
- **Future-Proof**: Can adapt when platforms change
- **Real Data**: Uses actual trending product data, not fake examples

---

```

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Required
FASTMOSS_EMAIL=your-fastmoss-email@example.com
FASTMOSS_PASSWORD=your-fastmoss-password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
HEYGEN_API_KEY=your-heygen-api-key

# Optional
KOLODATA_EMAIL=your-kolodata-email@example.com
KOLODATA_PASSWORD=your-kolodata-password
HEADLESS=true
MAX_PRODUCTS=5

---

## 🎯 **Smart Product Selection**

### **Automatic Filtering Criteria:**
- **Price Range**: $10-$100 (optimal for TikTok audience)
- **Commission Rate**: Minimum 15% (profitable for creators)
- **Sales Volume**: 1K-50K monthly (demand without oversaturation)
- **Rating**: 4.5+ stars (quality products only)
- **Competition Level**: Medium competition (opportunity available)

### **Opportunity Scoring:**
```python
Opportunity Score = (Revenue Potential × Quality Score) / Competition Factor
Revenue Potential = Price × Commission × Monthly Sales
Quality Score = Rating × Review Count × Trend Score
```

---

## ✍️ **Viral Script Generation**

### **AI-Powered Script Elements:**
- **Hook Templates**: Curiosity, problem-agitation, social proof, urgency
- **Psychological Triggers**: Scarcity, authority, social validation
- **Engagement Boosters**: Plot twists, attention grabbers, CTAs
- **Persona Matching**: Avatar selection based on product category

### **Script Structure:**
```
[0-3s] HOOK: "You'll never guess what happened when I tried this..."
[3-8s] PROBLEM: "I was struggling with [relatable problem]..."
[8-15s] SOLUTION: "This [product] completely changed everything..."
[15-18s] CTA: "Link in bio to get yours before it sells out!"
```

    'max_competition': 'medium' # Avoid saturated products
}
```

### **Script Customization:**

- Check API key and credits
- Verify avatar/voice IDs are valid
- Ensure script length is appropriate

**❌ Chrome WebDriver Error**
- Install/update Chrome browser
- Run: `pip install webdriver-manager`
- Check Chrome version compatibility

### **Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Run with detailed logging
HEADLESS=false python run_content_engine.py
```

---

## 📈 **Performance Optimization**

### **Speed Improvements:**
- Run scraping in parallel for multiple sources
- Cache product data to avoid re-scraping
- Batch API calls for script generation
- Use async processing for video creation

### **Cost Optimization:**
- Set daily API limits for OpenAI/HeyGen
- Use lower-cost models for initial testing
- Filter products before script generation
- Implement smart retry logic

---

## 🚀 **Scaling Up**

### **Production Deployment:**
