## üß† Core Modules

### 1. Persona & Script Engine
- Generates human-realistic personas using Claude + visual APIs.

- Voice and gestures tuned for psychological effect using marketing psychology principles.

### 2. Product Selection Logic
- Auto-scrapes high-converting products from TikTok Shop + affiliate networks.
- Filters products by:
  - Conversion rate (customizable threshold)
  - Historical performance
  - Current trend velocity
- You can define what "sells well" via a dashboard setting (e.g., 3%+ conversion rate, >10k purchases, >5k saves per video).

### 3. Video Formats
- Supports multiple types:
  - **Voice-based persona videos**
  - **Music-only emotional videos** (e.g., using Phonk tracks with no narration)
- AI matches product tone to format automatically.
- Emotional impact scoring rates candidate edits before publishing.
