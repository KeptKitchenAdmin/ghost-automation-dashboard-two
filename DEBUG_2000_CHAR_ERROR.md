# Debugging the 2000 Character Limit Error

## Investigation Summary

After thorough investigation, here's what I found:

### 1. **Deployment Status**
- ‚úÖ Latest code IS deployed (commit 2932eab from 1 minute ago)
- ‚úÖ Deployment is on `ghost-automation-dashboard-three.pages.dev`
- ‚úÖ The truncation code is present in the deployed API

### 2. **Code Analysis**
- ‚úÖ Truncation logic exists in `/api/generate-video-async` (line 125-128)
- ‚úÖ Story is truncated to 1950 chars if longer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback story is 1969 chars (19 chars over the limit!)
- ‚úÖ Frontend sends the correct story content (not enhanced version)

### 3. **Potential Issues Found**

#### Issue 1: Fallback Story Too Long
The fallback story in `reddit-stories.js` is 1969 characters, which after adding "..." becomes 1972 characters - still under 2000 but very close.

#### Issue 2: Browser Caching
The user might be running old cached JavaScript that doesn't hit the new API endpoint.

#### Issue 3: Wrong Cloudflare Project
The app is deployed to `ghost-automation-dashboard-three` but might be accessed via an old URL pointing to `ghost-automation-dashboard-two`.

## Immediate Actions for User

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
```
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

### 2. Verify Correct URL
Make sure you're accessing:
- `https://ghost-automation-dashboard-three.pages.dev`
- NOT the old `ghost-automation-dashboard-two.pages.dev`

### 3. Check Browser Console
When the error occurs, check:
1. Open DevTools Console (F12)
2. Look for these log lines:
   - "üìù Story Analysis:"
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è Story too long..."
   - "üìä TTS Payload Details:"
3. Share what the "Final Text Length" shows

### 4. Test with a Short Story
Try selecting a different story category and refresh stories to get shorter ones. The system filters for stories under 1900 chars.

## Code Fixes to Implement

### Fix 1: Shorten Fallback Story
```javascript
// In functions/api/reddit-stories.js, line 219
content: "So this happened to me last week. I was having a normal day when everything went wrong. First, my coffee maker broke with sparks flying. Then my car wouldn't start - dead battery. Stranded at home with no coffee or transportation. I tried working from home but internet went out. Just my house, apparently. Around noon, a massive tree fell across the street, blocking traffic and taking out power lines. That explained the internet. Then my boss calls, furious about missing emails. The client's threatening to cancel our biggest contract. She needs me in the office immediately. I explain about my car and the tree, but she thinks I'm making excuses. So I walk three miles to the office. Halfway there, it starts pouring rain. I take shelter at a bus stop where this guy's having an even worse day. We start talking about our impossible coincidences. Long story short, we help each other out, I make it to the office, save the client relationship, and everything works out. The whole experience made me think about how we handle adversity. Sometimes when everything goes wrong, it's really going right. What would you have done?",
```

### Fix 2: Add Extra Safety Buffer
```javascript
// In functions/api/generate-video-async.js, line 125
if (storyText.length > 1900) {  // More conservative limit
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è Story too long (${storyText.length} chars), truncating to 1900 chars`);
  storyText = storyText.substring(0, 1900) + "...";
}
```

### Fix 3: Add Request Validation
```javascript
// Add after line 123 in generate-video-async.js
// Validate story content before processing
if (!selectedStory.content || typeof selectedStory.content !== 'string') {
  throw new Error('Invalid story content: must be a non-empty string');
}

// Strip any potential hidden characters
let storyText = selectedStory.content.trim().replace(/[\x00-\x1F\x7F-\x9F]/g, '');
```

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate relief**: Have user clear cache and verify they're on the correct URL
2. **For permanent fix**: Deploy the shortened fallback story and extra validation
3. **For debugging**: Have user share console logs when error occurs

The issue is most likely browser caching or accessing the wrong deployment URL. The code has proper truncation, but we should make the fallback story shorter as an extra precaution.
